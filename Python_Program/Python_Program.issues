List of Issues (assuming database and table is already set up):
    -the sql statement in ReadTemperatures is not executed
    -the readOk loop will run infinitely/does not have an escape/end condition
    -the print function prints the wrong variable

General updates/recommendations or observations
    -close cursor and connection at end of execution
    -use append() to assign readings rather than appending at a specific index
    -add error handling where appropriate
    -include date checks in the query
